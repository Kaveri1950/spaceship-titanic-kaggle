# Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Competition

This repository contains code for the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic" where the task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Decision Forests
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

## Data
You can download the dataset for the competition from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data).

- `train.csv`: The training dataset.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset.
- `sample_submission.csv`: The submission format for the competition.

## How to Use
1. Install the dependencies.
2. Place the downloaded dataset files in the `data/` directory.
3. Run `model.py` to train the model and generate predictions.
4. A submission file will be generated as `submission.csv`.
